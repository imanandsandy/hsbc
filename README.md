#README for Fraud Detection Analysis
#Project Overview
This project aims to analyze and predict fraudulent transactions using a dataset provided in the train_hsbc_df.csv file. The analysis focuses on understanding the relationships between various features such as amount, merchant, and fraud labels. The project includes data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and building predictive models to identify fraudulent transactions.

Key Features and Insights
Precision Values:

Precision is a crucial metric in fraud detection, as it indicates the accuracy of identifying actual fraudulent transactions. A high precision means fewer false positives, ensuring that genuine transactions are not flagged as fraud.
In this analysis, precision values are calculated for different models to evaluate their effectiveness. The precision values are highlighted as they directly impact the business by reducing customer dissatisfaction due to false fraud alerts.
Fraud Count vs. Non-Fraud Count:


This imbalance is crucial because models can be biased towards predicting non-fraud due to the overwhelming number of such cases. Strategies like resampling, adjusting class weights, or using precision as a key metric help in mitigating this bias.
Fraud and non-fraud counts are highly correlated with other variables, particularly the transaction amount and merchant involved. These relationships are explored to enhance model accuracy.
Correlation with Amount and Merchant:

The amount involved in a transaction and the merchant where it takes place play significant roles in predicting fraud.
Analysis shows that certain merchants and transaction amounts are more prone to fraud, making these features critical in the model training process.
Visualizations and statistical tests are used to illustrate these correlations, helping in feature selection and model tuning.
Files in the Repository
hsbc.py: The main script containing the data loading, preprocessing, EDA, and model training code.
train_hsbc_df.csv: The dataset used for the analysis, containing various features related to customer transactions and the fraud label.
#Data Preprocessing
The dataset is loaded and cleaned by removing unnecessary columns like zipcodeOri and zipMerchant.
Missing values are handled, and categorical variables are encoded as necessary.
The data is split into training and testing sets for model evaluation.
Model Building and Evaluation
Several machine learning models are built and evaluated, with a particular focus on their precision in predicting fraud.
Models are fine-tuned using cross-validation and hyperparameter optimization to improve their performance.
The best-performing model is selected based on its precision, recall, and F1 score.
Visualizations
Various visualizations are generated to understand the distribution of fraud across different features.
Histograms, box plots, and correlation matrices are used to highlight key relationships.
Conclusion
This analysis provides a comprehensive approach to identifying fraudulent transactions, with a focus on precision and the role of key features like amount and merchant. The insights gained from this study can be applied to real-world scenarios where accurate fraud detection is critical.
